Methodology:
Hospital Quality in this analysis is evaluated based on the performance of two big types of measurements: Timely and effective care and readmission rate. The top quality hospitals should perform well in both of these two fields. Given different states would have a lot more or less hospitals, I believe taking the average among states based on hospital scores would be the best approach to measure the by state hospital quality. Therefore, I calculated such averaged quality score for each individual bucket same as questions 1 and take the top states that have the higher combined scores.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
1.	Given that different measures have inconsistent scales of score, in order to prevent skewing the result by measures with large scale, I have applied Scaling to the measure scores, and converted the scores to a value always between 0 and 1.

Results:
Based on the combined average score from both of the two fields, DE is the top ranked state. However, it only reports/has a really small number of hospitals which may not be very representative as an entire state. Therefore, I believe CO which ranks #5 and at the same time reported a great number of hospitals performance to be a good model for hospital quality.
