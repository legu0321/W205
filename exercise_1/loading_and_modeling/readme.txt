When designing the ER diagram, I did not combine the two tables: timely and effective care and readmission into one, given I believe these two evaluation items should have the equal weight and importance when determine the hospital quality. Also, these two fields of evaluations have very different number of measurements, if I combined them together, the overall result can be skewed or led by the one with more measurements, which is timely and effective care for this case.

Besides, I did not list in my ER diagram all the columns that each entity would have after transformation. I only listed the important ones, that are the unique identifier of the table or would be used as the foreign key to link with other table or the key column that I did my investigation with.
